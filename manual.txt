To run our code, you must include the following libraries:

    scikit-learn == 0.24.1
    numpy == 1.20.2
    matplotlib == 3.4.1
    pandas == 1.2.3
    graphviz == 0.16

You must also download all sub-libraries needed for the ones above. To do this, you can run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This should install all needed libraries. Alternatively, you can run:

    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install pandas
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install graphviz

While this method is not preferred, it should also do the job. Once you have installed the 
needed libraries, you can run the code by running Python and then entering the following
lines:

    >>> import preprocess
    >>> preprocess.pre_run()
